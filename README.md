# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews

This GitHub repository is dedicated to a comprehensive sentiment analysis project focused on Amazon product reviews. It offers an in-depth exploration of the sentiment behind user feedback on various products available on the platform.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into several parts, each addressing specific aspects of sentiment analysis and data exploration:

- **Part 1: Data Exploration:** In this section, we dive into the dataset's distribution, identify top reviewers, analyze review text lengths, and spotlight the highest-rated products and brands.

- **Part 2: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:** Part two is all about aspect-based sentiment analysis. We aim to understand how users feel about product warranties. This section provides detailed instructions on tackling this task.

- **Part 3: Sentiment Analysis Model:** The core of the project revolves around developing a sentiment analysis model. Your objective is to predict sentiment scores (ranging from 1 to 5) based on Amazon product reviews. You have the flexibility to choose your preferred model and preprocessing techniques, with an emphasis on domain-specific expertise.

- **Final Evaluation:** After creating the sentiment analysis model, you will evaluate its performance using a test dataset. The evaluation metric is the F1 micro score, and we provide guidelines on how to format and submit your predictions.

## Repository Structure

- The repository is organized into folders for each project part.
- Each part includes Jupyter notebooks with code and explanations.
- Data files and resources are provided for your convenience.
- A README file in each part's folder summarizes the goals and tasks for that section.
